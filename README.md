# Compound Maker - Javascript Web App

## Inspiration
I used to be a high school science teacher and two of my children are taking Chemistry next year. I decided to create a project that would showcase some of my javascript, HTML, CSS and logic skills while helping my children practice writing chemical formula and chemical names. I also had students that I have tutored recently that could have benefited from an app that would let them practice as much as they want, while checking their answers.

## How to Use
There are two sets of optinos that the user can select. One set of options is the included compound types for practice. The Ionic option is selected by default, but Acids or Molecular are available options. The other set of options is the included ion types for the Ionic and Acids options. Main Group Ions are the simplest and are selected by default. The user can also select Transition Metal Ions and/or Polyatomic Ions. The input fields for formulas are divs with contenteditable="true" set and an event listener that formats the superscripts and subscripts automatically.

There are six different sections of practice for Ionic compound types. Each of them have one or more buttons to get a new ion or compound. Each also has a check answer button. 'Name of the Ion' displays an ion formula and asks the user to name the ion. 'Formula of the Ion' displays the name of an ion and asks the user to write the formula of the ion. 'Compound from Symbols' displays a cation and anion, asking the user to provide the name and the formula of the resulting compound. 'Name from Formula' provides a formula and asks for the name of the compound. 'Formula from Name' provides the name of a compound and asks for the formula. 'Compound Formula Playground' has a dropdown lists of cations and anions where a user selects each and then writes the formula of the compound.

There are two different sections of practice for Acids and Molecular compound types: 'Name from Formula' and 'Formula from Name'.

### Technologies Used
Javascript
HTML
CSS

### Outstanding Bugs
The app will infrequently not refresh after creating a new Note or Topic, causing the new item to not appear without a refresh or logging back in.

### Proposed Future Functionality
Add subnote functionality
Add ability to add an image or video as a note
Add drag and drop or other method of changing the order of topics and notes within their groups
Add ability to move a Note or Topic to a different Topic
Provide the ability for a user to choose their own color schemes or themes or background
